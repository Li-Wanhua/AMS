# Test Appearance Model on test dataset  

This Model consist of three small models: depth model, RGB model and depth dynamic images model.   
Depth model takes depth videos as input.   
RGB model takes RGB videos as input.   
Depth dynamic images model takes depth dynamic images as input. Depth dynamic images is generated from depth video with rank pooling, which can use one image to represent one video's information.
